# Usage
## Initializing AVPlayer
Observe `VideoPlayer.player: Single<AVPlayer>` to get AVPlayer instance.

See: [Example](Example/)

## Monitor and Control state

Do not write `player?.pause()` any more.

See: [Example](Example/)

## Encrypted contents

`VideoPlayerFactory` initializer accepts `AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate`.
Set your instance which handles `EXT-X-KEY` methods.

## Handling Errors
TBD

See: [Example](Example/)

## Testing

See: [VideoPlayerTests](VideoPlayerTests/)

You can simulate player behavior by yourself to improve test coverage of your app.

# Build Example
1. Make sure your default `xcode-select -p` points at correct Xcode version.

2. Run following
   ```
   carthage bootstrap --platform iOS
   xcodegen
   ```

3. Open `Example.xcodeproj`
